# Battle-of-the-Neighborhoods

This project was done for the final project for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate and the dataset was provided by IBM. The task to be run on the dataset was our choice. I chose to find the safest neighborhoods in Seattle and find top amenities in those neighborhoods. I used the clustering algorithm to accomplish the task. The detailed report including the methodology and finding can be found here as well.
